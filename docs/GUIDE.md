## Terminology

### Frontmatter

The section at the top of each Whiskers template, beginning and ending with `---` (three consecutive dashes), is referred to as "frontmatter".
This section conveys important information to Whiskers through the `whiskers` key, and you can also add your own variables that will be added to the context.

### Tera

[Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/) is the templating engine powering Whiskers. Please familiarize yourself with the syntax before writing your first Whiskers template.

## Single file templates

Let's consider the following template:

`01-simple.tera`

```jinja
---
whiskers:
  version: "^2.5.1"
---
{%- for _, flavor in flavors %}
{{ flavor.emoji }} {{ flavor.name }}
{%- endfor %}
```

At the top, the frontmatter defines `whiskers.version`. This is a [Whiskers version requirement](./reference.md#version-requirement), allowing Whiskers to ensure it is rendering a template that it can understand.

Below the frontmatter is the body of the Whiskers template. The body contains a for loop over the entries of the `flavors` object, discarding the key (`_`) and setting the value of each entry to `flavor`.
We can compile this template with `whiskers 01-simple.tera`. Whiskers prints the following:

```
ðŸŒ» Latte
ðŸª´ FrappÃ©
ðŸŒº Macchiato
ðŸŒ¿ Mocha
```

To save this output to a file, we can define the `whiskers.filename` property in the frontmatter:

```diff
---
whiskers:
  version: "^2.5.1"
+ filename: "output.txt"
---
{%- for _, flavor in flavors %}
{{ flavor.emoji}} {{ flavor.name }}
{%- endfor %}
```

This instructs Whiskers to write the output of the template to `output.txt`. If the given filepath contains directories (`path/to/abc/output.txt`), Whiskers will automatically create all necesssary parent directories.

## Matrix templates

In most cases, a single template will need to result in multiple files (such as one for each flavor). This behavior is built-in to Whiskers through the `whiskers.matrix` property. The most basic usage of it is as follows:

```jinja
---
whiskers:
  version: "^2.5.1"
  matrix:
    - flavor
  filename: "{{ flavor.identifier }}.txt"
---
{{ flavor.emoji }} {{ flavor.name }}
```

In this template, `whiskers.matrix` instructs Whiskers to generate the template once for each flavor. Whiskers injects the `flavor` variable, containing the [flavor object](./reference.md#flavor) of the current matrix iteration (equivalent to `flavors[flavor]` under the hood) in each iteration. The `flavor` variable is used twice, once in `whiskers.filename` to dynamically generate a filename based on the name of the flavor -- executing this template will output the following files: `latte.md`, `frappe.md`, `macchiato.md`, and `mocha.md` -- and secondly to display the `emoji` and `name` properties of each flavor (see https://github.com/catppuccin/palette/blob/main/palette.json).

In addition to the mandatory `whiskers` object, you may define arbitrary keys in your frontmatter as an easier way of defining variables within the template's context. For example, consider the following template.

```jinja
---
accent: mauve
my_variable: xyz
whiskers:
  version: "2.3.0"
---
accent: {{ accent }} -> #{{ flavors.mocha.colors[accent].hex }}
my_variable: {{ my_variable }}
```

This outputs the following:

```
accent: mauve -> #cba6f7
my_variable: xyz
```

The `accent` key becomes the `accent` variable, which can be used with `{{ accent }}`, and the same with `my_variable` as `{{ my_variable }}`. A common use case is defining an accent color at the top of the template to use throughout. This is demonstrated in the above template, where we get the `mauve` key (from our `accent` variable) of the `flavors.mocha.colors` object to print the associated hex code.

All flavors are accessible in Whiskers templates through the `flavors` variable. If a template is using a flavor matrix, or the `--flavor` option, the `flavor` variable will contain the data for the current flavor, and additionally each color of the current flavor is available in the root context. This means you can use simply use a color by its identifier: red with `{{ red }}`, and blue with `{{ blue }}`.

Some ports simply need each color to be defined at the top, which can be acheieved by looping over the `flavor.colors` object.

```jinja
| Name | Identifier |
| ---- | ---------- |
{%- for _, color in flavor.colors %}
| {{ color.name }} | `{{ color.identifier }}` |
{%- endfor %}
```

## Filters

Tera has many [built-in filters](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/#built-in-filters), though the color modification and representation filters
are provided by Whiskers itself, such as `css_rgb` and `css_hsl`.

Colors may need to be modified from their original form - often, this is in the form of adjusting the opacity.
The Whiskers-provided `mod` filter lets us do this; red is normally `{{ red | css_rgba }}`, though we can set the opacity to 50% with `{{ red | mod(opacity=0.5) | css_rgba }}`.
