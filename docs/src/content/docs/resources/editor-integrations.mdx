The following recommended editor integrations will make it a nicer experience
writing `.tera` templates.

## VSCode

We recommend the [Better
Tera](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=uncenter.better-tera)
extension.

## Zed

We recommend the [Zed Tera](https://github.com/uncenter/zed-tera#installation)
extension.

## Helix

Helix has built-in support for Tera as of
[v25.07](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix/releases/tag/25.07).

## Neovim

Tera support can be installed in Neovim as of
[v0.11](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/v0.11.0) and with the
latest nvim-treesitter.

After starting Neovim, run the following command to install the `tera` parser.

<Code code={":TSInstall tera"} lang="shell" title='nvim' />
