Whiskers is a port creation templating tool custom-built for Catppuccin,
allowing developers to easily generate ports via template files.

For example:

- [catppuccin/windows9x](https://github.com/catppuccin/windows9x) generates a
combined file using all flavours and accents from a **single template**.
- [catppuccin/fleet](https://github.com/catppuccin/fleet) generates each flavour
(4 files) from a **single template**.
- [catppuccin/starlight](https://github.com/catppuccin/starlight) generates each
flavour and accent (56 files) from a **single template**.
- [catppuccin/zed](https://github.com/catppuccin/zed) generates each flavour and
accent, along with italics and no-italics variants from a **single template**.

Simply running `whiskers <template_file>` can regenerate all your files in an
instant, removing the need to painstakingly review hex codes and copy/paste
snippets to different files.

To install whiskers and get started writing templates, see the [Quick
Start](/getting-started/quick-start) section.

For a deeper understanding into why we created whiskers, see the RFC
"[CAT-0003-Whiskers](https://github.com/catppuccin/community/blob/main/rfc/CAT-0003-Whiskers.md)".
