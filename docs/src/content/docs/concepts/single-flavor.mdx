Running whiskers with the `--flavor/-f` flag causes it to run in single-flavor mode.

This means the chosen flavor is placed into the template context as `flavor`
and, for convenience, all of its colors are also placed into the context as
their respective identifiers (`red`, `surface0`, et cetera.)

For example, running the following template with `whiskers example.tera -f latte`:

```markdown title="example.tera"
---
whiskers:
  version: "^2.5.1"
---
I can use {{red.hex}} directly, instead of needing {{flavor.colors.red.hex}}.
```
