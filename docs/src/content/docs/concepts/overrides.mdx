The frontmatter and/or even the palette colors themselves can be overriden in
every Whiskers template. This is particularly useful when customising an
existing port generated by Whiskers.

## Frontmatter Overrides

Frontmatter overrides can be specified through the CLI via the `--overrides`
flag, taking in a JSON string resembling the frontmatter.

For example, this template uses a default `border_color` of `mauve`:

```yaml title="example.tera"
---
whiskers:
  version: "^X.Y.Z"
  filename: "example.yml"
border_color: "mauve"
---
theme:
  border_color: "{{flavor.colors[border_color].hex}}"
```

However, when running:

```console
$ whiskers example.tera -f mocha --overrides '{"border_color": "pink"}'
```

the `border_color` will be overridden to `pink`.

A "real world" example is
[catppuccin/cosmic-desktop](https://github.com/catppuccin/cosmic-desktop#generating-custom-configurations),
where the frontmatter has customisation options which can be overridden by the
user.

## Color Overrides

Color overrides can be specified through the cli via the `--color-overrides`
flag. This flag takes a JSON string like the following:

```json
{
  "all": {
    "text": "ff0000"
  },
  "mocha": {
    "base": "000000",
    "mantle": "010101",
    "crust": "020202"
  }
}
```

Using these overrides would set the `text` color to bright red for all flavors,
and the `base`, `mantle`, and `crust` colors to black/near-black for Catppuccin
Mocha.

<Aside type="note">
  The overrides for Catppuccin Mocha shown above are famously known as
  "OLEDppuccin" or "Americano", a popular override to make the background(s)
  black/near-black.
