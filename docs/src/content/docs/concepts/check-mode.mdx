You can use Whiskers as a linter with _check mode_. To do so, set the `--check`
option. Whiskers will render your template as per usual, but then instead of
printing the result it will check it against the expected output and fail with
exit code 1 if they differ.

This is especially useful in CI pipelines to ensure that the generated files are
not changed without a corresponding change to the templates.

In single-flavor mode, you must provide the path to the expected output file as
an argument to the `--check` option. In multi-flavor mode, the path is
unnecessary and will be ignored.

Whiskers will diff the output against the check file using the program set in
the `DIFFTOOL` environment variable, falling back to `diff` if it's not set. The
command will be invoked as `$DIFFTOOL <actual> <expected>`.

```console
$ whiskers theme.tera latte --check themes/latte.cfg
(no output, exit code 0)

$ whiskers theme.tera latte --check themes/latte.cfg
Templating would result in changes.
